These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>.git
   cd <YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   # yarn install
   # or
   # pnpm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   # yarn dev
   # or
   # pnpm dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized build artifacts.

   # or
   # yarn build
   # or
   # pnpm build
   ```
